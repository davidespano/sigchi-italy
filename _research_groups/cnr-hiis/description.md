### Main Research Interests
Our research activity is in methods and tools to support user interface designers, software developers, and end-users in obtaining systems that can be accessed from different contexts of use in such a way to improve usability, accessibility, and user experience. 
The main research areas concern: Context-Dependent Interactive Systems, End-User Development, Methods and Tools for Usability, Accessibility, and User Experience Evaluation, Human-Robot Interaction, Intelligent Interfaces, MultiModal User Interfaces, Accessibility, Emotion-based User Interfaces, Usability Engineering and Models for HCI. Such work has led to the development of several tools and applications, some of which are publicly available.

### Main Research Interests
The "ICT and Cognitive Psychology R&D Joint Lab" is a joint initiative of FBK and the Department of Cognitive Science (DIPSCO) at the University of Trento. The main objective of the lab is to facilitate research on (1) how to apply cognitive psychology approaches and constructs to better design digital technologies, in particular for what concerns aspects related to human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence; and (2) the use of novel approaches in computer science, specifically those based on machine learning and big data, to innovate education, research and clinical practices in psychology. The lab provides an open and multi-disciplinary context aimed at (a) fostering original research (b) promoting transfer of knowledge to industries, civil society, and education; and (c) training professionals in the fields of human-centric digital technologies.
